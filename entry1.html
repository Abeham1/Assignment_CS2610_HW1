		"Superstition:"
		<br>
			"The painting of the Last Supper done by Leonardo DaVinci gives rise to two
			of the best known superstitions in our day."
		<br>
			"These are:"
		<br>
			"1. Given the treachary of Judas, the saying comes that you should never have
			13 people seated for dinner."
		<br>
			"2. In the painting, Judas is seen knocking over the bowl of salt. The superstition of
			'spilling the salt' is then considered to reflect the acts of Judas and represents betrayal
			and treachary. The remedy also suggests taking a pinch of salt and throwing it over your left
			shoulder to blind the devil, who is traditionally considered to be upon the left shoulder. 
			while the angel is believed to be on the right."
